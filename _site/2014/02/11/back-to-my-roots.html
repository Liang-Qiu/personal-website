<p>Since my life was <a href="https://al3x.net/2012/11/11/alone-together-again.html">turned upside-down</a> in mid-2012, I haven’t had a good answer to the question “what do you do?”. I’ve been doing things, of course. I’ve traveled, consulted, advised, invested, and written. I spent a lot of time in museums and a lot of time staring at the ocean. I did things I wanted to do, and I did things I needed to do.</p>

<p>This has been the first time in over a decade that I haven’t had a full-time job for a long stretch. My knee-jerk response to that lack of definition was to jump back into a familiar structure. At the beginning of 2013, I rushed into a role at a startup that turned out not to be the right fit. Since then, I’ve cautiously evaluated the opportunities that have presented themselves.</p>

<p>To make things a little more surreal: a few weeks after I turned 30 this past October, Twitter went public, confirming that I never <em>need</em> to work again. (I’m still getting my head around that.)</p>

<p>So, what do you do when you don’t need a job?</p>

<p>I considered a bunch of options. Agonized, even. I thought about going back to school for subjects as diverse as computer science, philosophy, art, political science, economics, and architecture. I thought about writing full time. I was approached by VC firms, and by a number of startups looking for technical leadership. At my most frustrated, I even thought of <a href="http://www.salon.com/2000/02/10/zawinski/">pulling a jwz</a> and flaming out of tech entirely, maybe to make music or volunteer all the time or who knows what.</p>

<p>None of that felt right.</p>

<h2 id="finding-dobt">Finding DOBT</h2>

<p>When asked about my background, I usually mention that I grew up in DC and got my professional start there building software for campaigns and non-profits. This was well before the technology-driven victories of the Obama campaign, and even before Howard Dean’s pioneering use of online fundraising.</p>

<p>One of the instrumental figures in the Dean campaign’s use of technology was <a href="http://www.informationdiet.com/about">Clay Johnson</a>, who I first met during Twitter’s breakout year at <a href="http://sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> 2007. Clay immediately went on my mental list of people I’d like to work with someday. Since then, Clay has led efforts to open public data at the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/">Sunlight Foundation</a>, written an <a href="http://www.informationdiet.com/">influential book on conscious information consumption</a>, and has been fighting for procurement reform and innovation as a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/teammembers">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>.</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, I found myself sitting on the couch, a little demoralized after exploring yet another job opportunity that didn’t feel right. My <a href="http://nicoleabrodeur.com/">lovely and talented girlfriend</a> put on an episode of <em>The Daily Show</em> in which Jon Stewart was (justifiably) ranting on a recurring topic: the inefficiency of the <a href="https://www.va.gov/">VA</a>. At that moment, my train of thought: “Someone in tech needs to do something about this. I should do something about this. Who do I know who’s probably trying to do something about this? <em>Clay</em>.”</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://blog.dobt.co/2014/02/11/welcome-al3x/">joined up</a> with Clay, his talented technical co-founder <a href="https://github.com/adamjacobbecker">Adam</a>, and government relations whiz <a href="https://twitter.com/sidburgess">Sid</a> at <a href="http://www.dobt.co/">The Department of Better Technology</a>. Simply put, we’re making software that makes government work better.</p>

<p>Now <em>this</em> feels right.</p>

<h2 id="company-values">Company Values</h2>

<p>DOBT operates by a set of values that have, through experience, become very important to me: allowing and encouraging remote work, operating internally without titles, self-directed time management, and a non-dogmatic approach to building quality software products. I’ve seen enough <a href="https://al3x.net/2012/02/12/on-business-madness.html">business madness</a>, and DOBT eschews it all. We’re working to build something sustainable at both a financial and human level.</p>

<p>Supporting diversity in tech initiatives has been a personal cause, so it was equally important to me that the people I work with understand the necessity of overturning the exclusionary monoculture that so defines our industry today. DOBT is not only a company with a commitment to diversity, but we’re advocating for a streamlining of minority- and woman-owned government contracting set-asides. Those reforms will unlock some five billion dollars for workers who have been economically disadvantaged.</p>

<p>Lastly, what attracted me to DOBT was the idea of working with a group of people who believe in government, and believe that technology can be a force for positive momentum in government. The <a href="http://healthcare.gov/">HealthCare.gov</a> debacle is just one example of what an uphill battle we have to fight, but it’s unquestionably worth the effort. For all its faults and frustrations, government is a pillar of civilization and deserves a foundation of well-crafted and open technology.</p>

<p>I still believe in technology, I still believe in government, and I still believe in startups. I’m happy to be putting that all together again with my new colleagues at DOBT. I hope you’ll consider <a href="https://gist.github.com/adamjacobbecker/7105101">joining us</a>.</p>
