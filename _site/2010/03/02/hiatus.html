  <h1 id="on-hiatus">On Hiatus</h1>

<p>Over the past several years, this blog has gone from something that a few patient friends read to something with farther reach than I ever hoped or intended. This has been, alternately, flattering, infuriating, exhilarating, and terrifying.</p>

<p>I write for myself. Always have, always will. Writing helps me structure my ideas. I sit down to write when I’ve had something kicking around in my head that just won’t quit nagging at me. By the time I’m done, I can put that idea to rest and move on. Unfinished thoughts structured via writing yield catharsis. Ideally, this is how the process works for me.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve found the cathartic returns from blog-format writing to be diminishing. The ideas I’m trying to express never really get put to rest in my head when I write, now. Instead, they spark whole conversations that I never intended to start in the first place, conversations that leech precious time and energy while contributing precious little back. Negative responses I can slough off, but the sense that I’m not really crystalizing my unset thoughts by writing here is what bothers me.</p>

<p>So. It’s time for me to take a break from blogging for a while.</p>

<h2 id="what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>

<p>This is a hard decision. Right now, I have a number of posts queued up:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One about how developer platforms are communities first and products second, and about how healthy platforms grow and mature organically.</li>
  <li>One about the creative possibilities of the iPad, as a sort of counterweight to my criticisms of the device’s closed design.</li>
  <li>One about how Objective-C has been successful despite being a fairly limited programming language, and what other language and API designers can learn from that unlikely success.</li>
  <li>One about the necessity of treating the creative process behind technology as if you were performing magic, and the worth of opening your mind to unorthodox methodologies and approaches.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I think about not publishing these things, I’m a little heartbroken. I enjoy sharing ideas, even when my ideas are shot down. I try to get better at communicating, at arguing, at persuading. But lately, I’ve been caught in a rut. I feel as if my writing isn’t really improving thanks to blogging, certainly not to the degree that bloggers I admire like <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> have improved in the time I’ve been reading them. I feel as if I stumble from one unintentionally inflammatory post to the next without gaining any particular insight.</p>

<p>A feedback loop of positive emails and tweets has kept me blogging despite my frustrations, but I find I’m no happier after I finish a post than when I started. If anything, blogging leaves me stressed out, disappointed, or just stuck with the sense that I’ve wasted my time. That’s why I need to take a public step back from writing here for a good long stretch.</p>

<h2 id="what-may-yet-be">What May Yet Be</h2>

<p>I want to focus my creative energies outside of <a href="http://twitter.com/">work</a> on something more substantial than blogging. Co-authoring <a href="http://programmingscala.com/">Programming Scala</a> was deeply rewarding in a way that few other things in my life have ever been. I have another book project in the works, and I’d like to embark on that in the near future. It’s big project, though; daunting. I’ve been using blogging as a way of putting it off while still satisfying my itch to write.</p>

<p>I’ve also been a lax open source citizen. My coworkers at Twitter are <a href="http://twitter.com/about/opensource">cranking out great open source code</a>. I’m not pulling my weight in this respect – only one of those great projects on Twitter’s open source page has my avatar next to it. I have at least as many open source projects queued up as I do potential blog posts, and those projects may be a better illustration of how I view the craft of programming. Code can speak louder than words.</p>

<p>I’ll still contribute to <a href="http://gracelessfailures.com/">Graceless Failures</a>, the group blog of Scala tips and tricks I started in 2008. I’ll probably write for the <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/">Twitter Engineering Blog</a> on occasion. I may yet find another outlet for my writing on programming, particularly as it pertains to the study of programming languages; a simple and frictionless format like Reg Braithwaite’s <a href="http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic">homoiconic</a> is appealing. In the past, I’ve found it useful to have a dedicated place to dive deep into a particular topic of interest. This particular blog has always been too “general interest” to get highly technical.</p>

<p>Of course, I’ll be <a href="http://twitter.com/al3x">tweeting away</a>. Over time, I’m coming to realize what sort of messages I can communicate effectively via Twitter, and what sort I can’t. Twitter works least well for me when I try to cram big arguments down to 140 characters. Every medium has its particular sweet spot for a writer, and I’ve found that a combination of geeky humor, technical information-sharing, musical recommendations, and tidbits about my travels, drinking, and dining seem to make for the happiest followers on Twitter.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-few-months">The Next Few Months</h2>

<p>There are still friends who read this blog to hear about what’s going on in my life.</p>

<p>In May, I will be moving to Portland, Oregon, where I’ll continue to work for <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. Portland and the Pacific Northwest captured my heart and imagination in the time I’ve spent there, and I’m eager to get involved in the local community (tech and otherwise).</p>

<p>After all that, who knows. Maybe by later this year I’ll be ready to write here again. Maybe I’ll be in midst of researching my next book, too heads-down to come back to blogging. I’m not sure. But I thank you for having read this far, and I hope you’ll be generous enough with your time to read again, someday.</p>
