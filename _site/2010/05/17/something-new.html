<p>Imagine, for a moment, a bank that doesn’t suck.</p>

<p>A bank that doesn’t gouge you with fees.
A bank that doesn’t treat you like crap.
A bank that cares about design, but gets out of your way.
A bank that puts your money to work automatically.
A bank that’s building a platform for the future of personal finance.</p>

<p>I’ve imagined that bank, usually while on hold with my current bank after they’ve screwed something up. I want to be a customer of that bank. More than that, I want to make it happen.</p>

<p>So, I am.</p>

<p>Starting today, I’m joining <a href="http://banksimple.net/">BankSimple</a> as a co-founder, with the role of Chief Product &amp; Technology Officer. In a nutshell, I’m going to make sure we build something that’s simple, beautiful, and works really really well.</p>

<p>Walking away from Twitter wasn’t an easy decision. Working there has been a life- and career-changing experience. I’ve learned all sorts of lessons, made great friends, and worked on something that millions of people now use every day.</p>

<p>But millions of people also need a better bank.</p>

<p>It’s a different sort of problem than Twitter, and it’s going to be a very different sort of company. But I feel ready to take on the challenge that BankSimple presents, and I’m joining on with two brilliant people who’ve put a ton of thought into building a better bank.</p>

<p>If BankSimple sounds like something you want, here’s how you can help make it happen:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://banksimple.net/join/">Sign up</a> to be first to know when we launch.</li>
  <li><a href="http://banksimple.net/jobs/">Join the team</a>. We’re hiring interns for the summer, and we’ll be hiring programmers, designers, customer support, operations, and many other positions down the road.</li>
</ol>

<p>Or, just talk to me about it. Tell me what you want from it. I’m at <a href="mailto:alex@banksimple.net">alex@banksimple.net</a> for all things work-related, henceforth.</p>

<p>I’m excited. I’m energized. Today is the start of something great.</p>
