<p>An information management tool; essentially, a wikified outliner, or an outliner for linked data structures, depending on how you want to conceive of it.</p>

<p>At its simplest, My Lovely Assistant (“lass”, for short and for command line use) is an outliner that allows child nodes to be (links to) other documents. If you have a look at the forums for popular Mac OS X outliner OmniOutliner, you’ll see many a request for the addition of some sort of multi-document paradigm. Most anyone who’s gotten comfortable with an outliner finds it difficult to store information any other way, but the one-outline-at-a-time limitation of most outliners impedes many use cases. By linking outlines as one would pages in a wiki, it’s possible to build a rich web of hierarchically structured data while moving beyond a single-document mode of interaction.</p>

<p>One possible implementation, targeting the browser, is to represent every outline as a JSON document. Documents are linked together by making child nodes URLs; any URL ending in “.json” would be treated as a new structure to be nested within the document. JSON documents that are not structured as outlines could be included, and rendered on a “best effort” basis, perhaps through an extension framework. Imagine a master outline in which some of the children are outlines in their own right, but other children are “live” JSON data from around the web: Twitter users or statuses, books from the Times Best Sellers list, etc.</p>

<p>A more desktop-oriented implementation could simply treat “outline nodes” as the Mac OS X Finder does nested folders when in column view. Click on a nested outline, and the interface swoops to the right to bring its contents into focus while retaining a visual linkage between the child outline and its parent node.</p>

<p>This is another thing that I’ve wanted to use every day since I thought of it. I’m aware of other attempts at wiki/hypertext-capable outliners, but none have caught on.</p>
