  <h1 id="software-i-paid-for-but-no-longer-use">Software I Paid For But No Longer Use</h1>

<p>As much as I like open source, I enjoy paying for software. Give me a good solution with a nice interface, and I’ll give you some reasonable amount of money.</p>

<p>Digital life being fluid and transient, even paid software can quickly fall to the bottom of the virtual junk drawer. Sometimes I feel that an application was worth paying for if only for temporary use, and sometimes not.</p>

<p>Towards the end of discovering which purchases I valued and which I regret, two lists.</p>

<h2 id="desktop-apps">Desktop Apps</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://acquisitionx.com/">Acquisition</a> — file sharing has long since moved on from Gnutella. I’ve heard it said that there’s no sense in paying for file sharing software, and I think I’ve come around to that. Moderate regret.</li>
  <li><a href="http://mirasoftware.com/BPE2/">BluePhoneElite</a> — worth every penny, even though its days are over. The iPhone can’t do all the tricks that my <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/cell-phones/sony-ericsson-t616-at/4505-6454_7-20912537.html">Sony Ericsson T616</a> could do when hooked up to BluePhoneElite. No regret.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nullriver.com/products/connect360">Connect360</a> — worked great while I had an Xbox, but I’ve long since sold it. Moderate regret.</li>
  <li><a href="http://growlichat.com/download.php">GrowliChat</a> — deprecated by <a href="http://www.ksuther.com/chax/">Chax</a>, which I also no longer use but never paid for. I’m not sure why I ever wanted Growl notifications for IM presence, as it’s distracting and useless. Little regret, though, as it was all of $5.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> — slight regret. I have enough of a personal organizational system set up that this automated filing utility didn’t really provide much benefit for me.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> — I always just wanted to write blog posts in my text editor, and now I can. No regret, though, as I got MarsEdit for free when I bought a license for…</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">NetNewsWire</a> — no regrets here. I’ve long since switched to <a href="http://google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> by way of <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">NewsFire</a> (see below), but at the beginning of my blog-reading days, NNW was essential and a pleasure to use.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">NewsFire</a> — paid for it, loved its simplicity compared to NNW, but then it was made free. Moderate regret.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bitcartel.com/pandorajam/">PandoraJam</a> — this was useful when Twitter had a shared AirPort speaker in the office, as it took most of the personal taste out of what got played. (“Don’t blame me, I put it on the Joy Division station.”) Now that I use <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a> whenever I want streaming music, I don’t really need this app. Moderate regret.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.techspansion.com/">Visual Hub</a> — used it a few times, but then the app got discontinued and open-sourced. I recall buying this right before a trip, desperate to find an easy way to convert some movies to an iPhone-friendly format. It wasn’t worth it, and I regret not using open source tools for this specialized task. Deep regret.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.xtorrentp2p.com/">Xtorrent Pro</a> — integrated search and feed subscriptions are killer features for a BitTorrent client. My need for Xtorrent was obviated by <a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a>, though, which carries all the shows that used to, uh, magically appear on my hard drive. Slight regret, but probably worthwhile.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="iphone-apps">iPhone Apps</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.pangeasoft.net/iphone/enigmo/info.html">Enigmo</a> — deep regret. I bought it when it was $9.99 without remembering that I don’t actually enjoy playing games. Beat a few levels, deleted it.</li>
  <li><a href="http://sketchesapp.com/">Sketches</a> — I can’t draw on paper, much less on a touch screen, and I’ve never had the desire to do so since the day I bought Sketches. Moderate regret. I keep it on my iPhone in case the need/desire to sketch arises anew.</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_Origins">Spore Origins</a> — same story as Enigmo. I was eagerly awaiting Spore, because I thought it was the sort of game I might enjoy, and bought this tedious thing instead. Deep regret.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mustacheinc.com/summizer">Summizer</a> — a great app, but most of its functionality can now be found in <a href="http://www.atebits.com/software/tweetie/">Tweetie</a>. Moderate regret, but I’d have none if it had been cheaper.</li>
  <li><a href="http://iconfactory.com/home/permalink/2009">Twitterrific</a> — pretty the same deal as Summizer. Twitterrific has a much stronger design sensibility than Tweetie, but Tweetie does more and does it faster. No regret, though, as I used it happily for months.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-morals">The Morals</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Don’t buy games (if you’re me).</li>
  <li>Don’t buy file sharing apps.</li>
  <li>Don’t buy apps for things you only need to do once in a blue moon. Find a free/open solution.</li>
  <li>Don’t buy iPhone apps on impulse.</li>
  <li>Expect that software you buy to integrate with a particular piece of hardware probably won’t have a long life, so budget accordingly.</li>
</ol>
