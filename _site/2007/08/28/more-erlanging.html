<p>One of my favorite reads from my infosec days was <a href="http://blogs.23.nu/c0re/">teenage mutant ninja hero coders</a>, a blog by computer security expert <a href="http://md.hudora.de/">Maximillian Dornseif</a>. Dornseif usually says smart things and you should probably be reading him.</p>

<p>Lately, his subject matter has turned to more general programming topics and distributed systems. Dornseif <a href="http://blogs.23.nu/c0re/stories/15740/">wrote about Erlang’s unsubstantiated reliability claims</a> recently, and <a href="http://blogs.23.nu/c0re/stories/15811/">follows up on that</a> today.</p>

<p>Dornseif’s point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Erlang is an interesting language. OTP is great engineering. Erlang has considerable momentum compared to other languages with unusual concepts. There is no need use 99.9999999% which ring[s] so hollow.” That’s pretty easy to agree with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve seen two conflicting schools towards the end of figuring out where Erlang fits in the current programming language landscape. One is the ever-popular “right tool for the right job” school, which posits that you build your distributed components in something like Erlang and other components in languages with more mature, easy-to-use libraries. While this is admirable and pragmatic, the downside is that you then have to couple your tools with language bridges or interoperable formats like XML, JSON, or a message queuing standard. The coupling components can be brittle or eat up processing time with expensive parsing and conversion.</p>

<p>The opposing school is well-represented by, again, <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/what-about-sun-embracing-javascript">Russ Beattie</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>” […] I just don’t like working with multiple languages at the same time. I much prefer to have one language in my toolbox that I try to use for as much as possible, so that I can avoid time-sapping context changes, re-use code, and become more proficient with each line of code I write whether its on the desktop, in the browser or on the server.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve known lots of developers for whom a solution isn’t a solution if it isn’t available in their language of choice. Context-switching can, indeed, be brutal.</p>

<p>At the moment, I’m not ready to take a side. I’ve always been a multi-linguist, and I see ups and downs to both sides. It’s interesting, is all.</p>
