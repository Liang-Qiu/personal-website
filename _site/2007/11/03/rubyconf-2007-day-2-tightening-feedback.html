<p>I missed the sessions after lunch due to a soul food stupor. I regret nothing. Currently up: Phil Hagelberg on “tightening the feedback loop,” pragmatic strategies for integrating testing into the development cycle.</p>

<p>Hagelberg begins with a run-through of available Ruby testing tools, including Test::Unit, RSpec, and autotest. A quick poll of the room suggests that a vast majority are using some sort of test automation.</p>

<p>Still, Hagelberg suggests that autotest can be cumbersome and requires too much switching between the editor and terminal. He offers Flymake - which shows compiler warnings in-editor - as an intermediate improvement. A screenshot of a personal experiment with an improved visualization strategy is shown.</p>

<p>Then, a discussion of the <a href="">feedback principle</a> that feedback is the output of a system is being fed back into the system’s input. This raises questions of what to measure, how to measure it, and when to feed the output back into the system.</p>

<p>Measuring the accuracy of feedback involves identifying a metric you care about, automating the measurement of that metric, and bringing notification of changes to the developer. Of course, one has to measure “meta-accuracy”, ensuring your testing system itself is reliable and trustworthy. Tools like heckle and rcov can provide a baseline of sanity for your test coverage.</p>

<p>Testing the human-percieved maintainability of one’s code is another challenge. While flog can offer some help, Hagelberg also suggests being judicious about a focused, clear commit strategy.</p>

<p>Measuring performance in an automated way is worth doing. While using a profiler is a very manual process, you can measure “black-box” response times in automated way, for example with a script that makes requests against your application. The results of these performance measurements should be visible and readily available. Keeping a history of feedback data is suggested.</p>

<p>Hagelberg has a tool called <a href="http://augment.rubyforge.org/">Augment</a> that he then demos. Augment can ANSII-color files to show errors and failures in yellow and red respectively. Output is stored as JSON (for multi-language interchange) in an augment/ directory in your project. There’s also an Emacs helper to bring the colorized output into the editor.</p>
